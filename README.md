# Privacy Space

[Source code](https://github.com/GeekTR/PrivacySpace)  [中文文档](https://github.com/Xposed-Modules-Repo/cn.geektang.privacyspace/blob/main/README_CN.md)



This is an **Xposed** module. The function of this module is to "hide" the apps so that no other apps can find them, which can achieve the "Second space" function of MIUI. We can use this module to hide the Xposed module, or some relatively private apps to protect our privacy.

## Notice

1. If random package names are enabled in your Magisk app, whitelist it. Otherwise, the apps moved to the "Privacy Space" cannot obtain the Root permission correctly. 

2. Apps that move to the "Privacy Space" can be launched by clicking the APP icon on the "Privacy Space" home page. 

3. If you don't want to hide an app (such as the desktop app), you can add it to the whitelist.

4. If you use this module to hide some system apps, the system may fail to boot after the restart. Therefore, exercise caution when hiding system apps. 

5. If this module causes your system to fail to boot, you can restart the system again after connecting to the computer and executing "adb uninstall cn.geektang.privacyspace" on the system load page (with USB debugging enabled).

## Todo

They will coming soon in future.

- [x] Add the search function on the app list page. 

- [x] Adapt to Android version 8-10.

- [x] Fixed the bug that some mobile phones crashed directly without root permission. 

- [x] Remove the dependency on root permissions. 

- [ ] Install Xposed module to automatically hide (user optional). 

- [ ] When the Xposed module is hidden, the user can choose whether to add its recommended app as its "Connected App".

## Scope

1. System Framework (**required**)

2. Targeted hooks can be made when the non-Android system scope is checked (used when the hidden function cannot take effect after System Framework is checked)
